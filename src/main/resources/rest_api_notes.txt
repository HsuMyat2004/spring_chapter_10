@RestControllerAdvice
Is basically @ControllerAdvice + @ResponseBody.
This means:
It applies to all controllers by default (both @Controller and @RestController).
All methods inside it automatically return JSON/XML (no need to add @ResponseBody).
Primarily used for global exception handling in REST APIs.
